    <p>Last week was the last one at my old job.</p>

<p>After 2 years of doing mixed work of web developer and project manager, I decided it's time to figure out which direction to go and take some time off to relax. And I would finally have some time to visit my family and friends.</p>

<p>To my boss I said: "I need some time without PC" and this is the story I've been telling to everyone and to myself.</p>

<p>But it's not true.</p>

<h2 id="realization">Realization</h2>

<p>Today, I have received notification from Github:</p>

<pre><code>@hovancik ping.
</code></pre>
<p>It's from one of few opened PRs on my open-source projects. This PR is from March 27 and it's not the oldest one. That would be from Jul 5, 2017, almost a year ago.</p>

<p>And it's also not the only PR that someone is inquiring about.</p>

<p>Thinking about it I realized something that I didn't want to admit: the true reason for my "time off" is to find time to finish what I never managed to do in last months: opened PRs, bugs, unpublished projects.</p>

<h2 id="guilt">Guilt</h2>

<p>I don't know how to describe it, but there is a kind of guilt behind it: I'm failing my projects, my users, I'm not doing "my work". Problems at my day-to-day work had part in what I am going through as well.</p>

<p>And I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's here and it's having consequences.</p>

<p>It's hard to explain, but even when writing this I feel that hard-to-describe feeling of my head going to break at any moment, without-any-reason stress that you can feel physically, notion that you are stuck without any possible way out. It's sometimes hard to do anything at all, mind racing here and there.</p>

<p>And yes, I've become less careful and ended up screwing up stuff that costed me a lot of time and effort, resulting in more bad things happening.</p>

<p>Looking back, how many nights did I come back from work not able to talk to anyone, just quietly sitting for an hour or two? Or getting drunk so I can feel relaxed next day?</p>

<p>I should have known then.</p>

<p>But as this is rather day by day change, it's hard to see that one goes in the wrong direction.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning-of-the-end">The beginning of the end</h2>

<p><em>In here, I wanted to write when, where and how I went wrong. Unfortunately, I don't know.</em></p>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going forward</h2>

<p>Even though I should take the "time off" I was telling everyone I'm taking, I still want to do some unfinished work. There are few PRs I need to close as RGSoC is starting soon. And if it goes well, I might do some other ideas as well.</p>

<p>But I also want to take care of myself.</p>

<p>This means incorporating few changes to my life:</p>
<ul>
  <li>coming back to exercising in the morning - it makes me energized</li>
  <li>more meditating and mindfulness - so I can see when my mind goes in wrong direction</li>
  <li>spending less time in front of PC</li>
  <li>more time in park with good book</li>
  <li>more time with friends</li>
  <li>making my life and work more organized to keep my mind free of worries</li>
  <li>figuring out how to find balance with my open-source apps - learning to tell people I have a life, too ;]</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's see how it goes.</p>
