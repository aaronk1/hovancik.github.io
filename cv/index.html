<h2>Lead Analyst / Product Manager</h2>
<h3>Box+Dice, Prague (Czechia), 2018 - 2019</h3>
<p>
  After wearing two hats of developer and project manger, I got tempted
  to cover more ground in product and found myself in the Australian company
  working with teams and partners around the globe. I enjoyed communication
  with third parties and finding a way how to best fulfill their wishes while
  respecting the needs of our customers. I had the opportunity to see
  the work of a developer from different perspective after I was responsible
  for product development, prioritizing, allocation and managing the team of developers and testers.
  After implementing several integrations and successful release of mobile app,
  my next goal was the alignment of all of the platforms of the company.
